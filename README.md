Notes:
  * fruchterman reingold force-directed simulation, all performed on the GPU
  * 60 FPS simulation for scenes with 1 million nodes
  * single-click on a node to see only it's neighbors
  * double click to clear selection

click the force-direction graph icon a couple of times to speed up the particle simulation
